### Introduction

*CanvasPong* is a self-made tutorial to get know the canvas-tag in HTML5. This tag is a nice way to build HTML5 games with **JavaScript**.

### Background

I had to learn *JavaScript* for a web engineering assignment to build a own game in canvas. After many hours of web searching I had the idea to build **Pong** in canvas and publish it as a tutorial for others.  
So **CanvasPong** was born. This is also my first tutorial ever but it won't be my last. I want to create and publish new tutorial of any kind - I just want to give you some neet content.
